# code-to-calender

## Description

Automatically adds Competitive Programming Events from various websites to your Google Calendar and remind you 10 minutess before the event.

I developed this small utility as I had to go through various competitive programming websites and then add it to my calender manually. 
Also, I didn't want to authorize any more unnecessary applications for this simple task. I thought of doing it myself.
